## Election-Audit Summary
The script developed for this congressional election audit report could be easily repurpose for the next election in this precint and even for other precincts.  Some of the main reasons are:
- This script has the capability of incorporating any number of cadidates and counties as it not hard coded, so it is practical and flexible.
- The wording for the messages is easily editable so that can be changed in the future with any other wording that the commision would like to use. so it can be tailormade.  
- Another modifications could be adding a date of the election audit results report. 
- This code can easily accept some modifications. For example if the Commission would like to know how many voters the winning candidate got from each county by using the ballot id. (For this, additional data would be needed from the Commission to relate the id with the counties/precints)
