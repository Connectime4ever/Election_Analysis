 Election Analysis
## Overview of Election Audit

### This project contributes to provide with additional information to complete the report of a congressional election audit results, by using Python as a programming language. In this sense, the initial code was elaborated more to get the new outputs requested by the Commission.    
# The Commission expects to have the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count and the county with the highest turnout.

## Election-Audit Summary
The script developed for this congressional election audit report could be easily repurposed for the next election in this precinct and other precincts.  Some of the main reasons are:
- This script has the capability of incorporating any number of candidates and counties as it not hard coded, so it is practical and flexible.
- The wording for the messages is easily editable so that can be changed in the future with any other wording that the commission would like to use, so it can be tailor-made.  
- Another modification that can be done is adding a date on the election audit results report. 
- Other possible feature that could be incorporate is for example,  if the Commission would like to know how many voters the winning candidate got from each county by using the ballot id. (For this, additional data would be needed from the Commission to relate the id with the counties/precincts)
